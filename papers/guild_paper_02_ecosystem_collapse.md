### Abstract

Ecological systems are often evaluated in terms of biodiversity, carbon storage, or tipping points, but rarely through the lens of entropy management. This paper introduces a thermodynamic model of ecosystem health using the QIH (Quantified Inference of Health) framework. We model the Amazon Rainforest as a complex entropy-regulating system and propose that ecological collapse corresponds to a failure of adaptive entropy export. We define QIH in ecological terms, identify measurable proxies for entropy flux and boundary responsiveness, and track changes in thermodynamic resilience across time. Our findings suggest that ecosystem degradation leads not only to structural loss, but to declining capacity for adaptive entropy management. This is a collapse not only of biomass, but of informational coherence.

### 1. Introduction: Collapse as Entropy Imbalance

The Amazon Rainforest is one of the most complex and biologically dense ecosystems on Earth. It is also approaching a critical transition, driven by deforestation, climate shifts, and trophic simplification that may be irreversible on relevant timescales.

Conventional approaches frame this collapse in terms of species loss, reduced carbon sequestration, or changes in rainfall. But beneath these observations lies a deeper question: **what does it mean, thermodynamically, for an ecosystem to stay alive?**

This paper proposes that **ecosystem collapse is a thermodynamic failure**: a breakdown in the system’s ability to adaptively export entropy while maintaining boundary coherence. We apply the QIH framework to model ecological resilience as a function of entropy flux and system responsiveness.

### 2. The QIH Framework in Ecological Systems

We define ecological health using the QIH equation:

$$
Q_{\text{ih}}(t) = B(t) \cdot \frac{d^2 \Phi(t)}{dt^2}
$$

Where:  
$$\Phi(t)$$

is entropy flux, measured in J/K·m²·s as the rate at which the ecosystem exports entropy through heat, moisture, and biochemical cycling per unit area  

$$\frac{d^2 \Phi}{dt^2}$$

is the acceleration of entropy export, indicating whether the system is becoming more or less adaptive over time  

$$B(t)$$

is a dimensionless boundary responsiveness factor, reflecting the system's coherence and ability to buffer, sense, and respond to entropy inputs

In this model, **collapse begins when entropy export slows and the system loses its ability to accelerate recovery**.

If $$Q_{\text{ih}}$$

becomes negative, the system is no longer adaptively managing entropy and instead it is degrading.

### 3. Entropy Export in Forest Systems

In a stable rainforest, entropy is exported through:

- **Evapotranspiration**: moisture and latent heat are released to the atmosphere  
- **Decomposition**: heat and chemical energy are dissipated through microbial decay  
- **Radiation balance**: the canopy absorbs and re-emits solar energy  
- **Trophic cycling**: species interactions redistribute energy and matter with redundancy

These processes enable the system to maintain **low internal entropy** by exporting disorder to the surrounding environment. High entropy export allows forests to sustain their complexity and resist degradation.

### 4. Collapse Dynamics and QIH Decline

As anthropogenic pressures rise, QIH declines.

Specifically:

- **Deforestation** reduces canopy density, lowering evapotranspiration and radiation coupling  
- **Fire regimes** disrupt decomposition cycles and increase chaotic energy release  
- **Biodiversity loss** weakens trophic feedback loops, impairing resilience  
- **Soil degradation** reduces microbial cycling and thermal conductivity

This leads to:  
$$\Phi(t)$$ decreasing  
$$\frac{d^2 \Phi}{dt^2} < 0$$ entropy export slowing  
$$B(t)$$ collapsing due to fragmented ecological boundaries

Once QIH drops below a critical threshold, the system may not recover without external reorganisation.

### 5. Proxy Measures for Ecological QIH

To operationalize QIH, we propose the following proxies:

| QIH Term | Proxy | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| $$\Phi(t)$$ | Net radiation balance (latent + sensible heat), soil respiration, evapotranspiration | Measures energy and moisture export |
| $$\frac{d^2 \Phi}{dt^2}$$ | Year-over-year change in Φ, smoothed over 3–5 years | Indicates acceleration or deceleration in entropy export |
| $$B(t)$$ | Biodiversity-weighted trophic network coherence, ecosystem response time to drought/fire, satellite-observed recovery lag | Composite measure of boundary sensitivity and coherence |

> *Note: Entropy in this context refers to physical energy dispersion (e.g. J/K·m²·s), not metaphorical disorder.*

### 6. Worked Example (2000–2025): QIH in the Amazon

We examine changes in ecological QIH using observational estimates from the southern Amazon basin:

#### Inputs (sources: NASA MODIS, INPE, WWF):

- Evapotranspiration: ↓ 15% since 2000  
- Species richness: ↓ 20% in edge zones  
- Fire frequency: ↑ 60% since 2000  
- Recovery lag (NDVI): ↑ 40% in burned areas

#### Interpreted Trajectory:

$$\Phi(t)$$ is declining due to heat/moisture loss  
$$\frac{d^2 \Phi}{dt^2} < 0$$ — entropy export slowing  
$$B(t)$$ is decreasing due to feedback fragmentation

Together, these indicate a **falling QIH trajectory**—a system in progressive collapse, with diminishing ability to restore thermodynamic resilience.

> *These estimates are illustrative and based on publicly available remote sensing and ecological monitoring data.*

### 7. Resilience and Reversibility

QIH provides a way to quantify **how close the Amazon is to irreversible collapse**.

To recover QIH:  
$$\Phi(t)$$ must be restored via reforestation and moisture coupling  
$$B(t)$$ must be rebuilt via biodiversity corridors, indigenous stewardship, and trophic repair  
$$\frac{d^2 \Phi}{dt^2}$$ must become positive—evidence that entropy export is not just occurring, but recovering

> *Note on hysteresis: Even if $$\Phi(t)$$ increases again, $$B(t)$$ may lag due to trophic and hydrological fragmentation. This delay must be modeled explicitly when assessing recovery timelines.*

### 8. Conclusion: Entropy at the Edge

The Amazon is not simply a carbon sink or biodiversity storehouse. It is an active **entropy-processing system**—and its decline is best understood thermodynamically.

QIH offers a formal model for diagnosing ecological resilience, collapse, and recovery. If we can measure entropy export acceleration and boundary responsiveness, we can quantify the health of entire ecosystems—and know when they are truly in danger of tipping beyond return.
