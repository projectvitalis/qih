❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. What is QIH?

QIH (Quantified Inference of Health) is a thermodynamically grounded signal that measures a system’s adaptive capacity to export entropy. It quantifies how effectively a system maintains internal order by offloading entropy to its environment—especially under changing or stressful conditions.

2. Why use entropy flux instead of biological or behavioural proxies?

Entropy flux is a universal, measurable signal that applies across domains—from human physiology to ecosystems, AI, and markets. Unlike proxies such as heart rate variability or cortisol, entropy flow captures the underlying physics of adaptation and fragility in any system.

3. How is this different from homeostasis or allostasis?
	•	Homeostasis describes equilibrium.
	•	Allostasis describes adaptive stability through change.
	•	QIH captures the acceleration of entropy export, which quantifies how dynamically a system adapts.

QIH isn’t about balance—it’s about directional thermodynamic responsiveness.

⸻

4. What does a high or low QIH mean?
	•	High QIH → The system is rapidly increasing its entropy export.
It’s likely adapting, offloading load, or responding to changing demands.
	•	Low or negative QIH → The system is losing regulatory momentum.
It may be stiff, depleted, collapsing, or on the edge of failure.

QIH does not measure how active a system is—it measures how adaptively responsive it is under load.

5. How can I apply QIH in my field?

If you can estimate or approximate:
	•	dS_internal/dt → Internal entropy production (e.g. heat, disorder, workload)
	•	Φ(t) → Entropy export rate (e.g. cooling, excretion, data offload, CO₂ release)
	•	B(t) → Boundary responsiveness (e.g. skin, firebreaks, membranes, APIs)

…then you can model QIH using:

Q_{ih}(t) = B(t) \cdot \frac{d^2\Phi(t)}{dt^2}

QIH is domain-neutral and physically grounded.
Use it to monitor health in humans, ecosystems, machines, or institutions.
