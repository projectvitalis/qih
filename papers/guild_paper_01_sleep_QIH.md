## Abstract

Sleep is often described as restorative, yet it is rarely modelled as an active entropy-management process. This paper uses the QIH (Quantified Inference of Health) framework to formalize sleep as a thermodynamic phase of entropy export. We define high-quality sleep as a period of increasing entropy flux and responsive boundary regulation, both of which contribute to a system’s adaptive capacity. Using recent findings in glymphatic clearance, neural entropy dynamics, and circadian feedback, we show how QIH offers a physical, testable measure of health through sleep. This approach bridges physiology and physics, enabling new predictions for collapse, recovery, and resilience in biological systems.

## 1. Introduction

Health is typically defined in clinical or behavioural terms—as the absence of disease or the presence of subjective well-being. In contrast, this paper models health as a **thermodynamic capacity**: the ability of a system to regulate internal disorder through adaptive entropy export. The QIH framework expresses this capacity in physical terms, with measurable components and a defined unit (J/K·s³).

Sleep offers a compelling test case. It is a conserved behaviour across species, tightly linked to homeostatic recovery, yet its function has remained partly mysterious. We propose that **the primary role of sleep is entropy export**—a structured process of internal disorder reduction. When sleep is healthy, QIH rises. When sleep fails, QIH declines, and systemic collapse often follows.

## 2. Background: Sleep as Entropy Regulation

Recent research supports a thermodynamic view of sleep:

- The **glymphatic system** activates during sleep to clear metabolic waste from the brain, reducing molecular disorder and maintaining cellular homeostasis ([PMC8990473](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39995712/)).
- **Shannon entropy metrics** derived from EEG signals (e.g., Sleep Temporal Entropy, STE) predict cardiometabolic risk and outperform standard sleep scoring in health outcomes ([Ruffini et al., 2023](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/14/3/926)).
- **Spectral entropy analysis** of REM–NREM transitions suggests sleep is an entropy-driven attractor cycle.

These findings show that entropy-related signals are deeply embedded in sleep architecture. However, they remain descriptive. QIH builds on this work by offering a **mechanistic, unit-based framework** that links entropy flux to adaptive health capacity over time.

## 3. Definition of QIH in Sleep

We define QIH as:

$$
Q_{\mathrm{ih}}(t) = B(t) \cdot \frac{d^2 \Phi(t)}{dt^2}
$$

Where:

- $$\( \Phi(t) \)$$: entropy flux (J/K·s), measurable through glymphatic clearance or EEG entropy slope  
- $$\( B(t) \)$$: boundary responsiveness (dimensionless), proxied by HRV, temperature variability, or inflammation regulation  
- $$\( \frac{d^2 \Phi(t)}{dt^2} \)$$: acceleration of entropy export (J/K·s³)

**Units of QIH**:  
(J/K·s³)

High QIH reflects a system that is adaptively accelerating its entropy export which is an indicator of resilience and health.

## 4. Example: Sleep Across 24 Hours

To understand how QIH reflects real-world system dynamics, we can walk through a simplified 24-hour cycle of sleep and wakefulness. This example uses illustrative values to show how entropy export and boundary responsiveness change throughout the day, and how those changes affect system health.

We assume the following:

- **During wakefulness**, the body and brain accumulate entropy. Neural signalling, metabolic processes, and environmental inputs all contribute to internal disorder. Entropy flux $$\( \Phi(t) \)$$ is low, and boundary responsiveness $$\( B(t) \)$$ is focused on outward tasks, not internal regulation. QIH is minimal or slightly negative, as disorder builds faster than it can be cleared.

- **As sleep onset begins**, parasympathetic tone rises, melatonin is released, and the system begins shifting inward. Glymphatic flow activates, and entropy flux $$\( \Phi(t) \)$$ increases. Disorder is actively being exported. If boundary responsiveness also improves (e.g. smooth circadian transitions, low inflammation), the second derivative of $$\( \Phi(t) \)$$ becomes positive. QIH rises.

- **In deep sleep**, the system reaches peak efficiency in entropy clearance. Glymphatic waste removal accelerates. Brain activity slows and synchronizes. This is the most efficient phase for entropy export. $$\( \Phi(t) \)$$ is high and still increasing, $$\( B(t) \)$$ is strong, and QIH is at its peak. This is when recovery happens. It is not because sleep is restful, but because the system is effectively regulating disorder.

- **During REM cycles**, entropy flux may fluctuate as dream activity increases and boundaries become more porous. But in healthy sleep, the system maintains enough responsiveness to sustain QIH through these oscillations.

- **In sleep deprivation or fragmentation**, this profile breaks down. Sleep may be too shallow, too short, or poorly timed. In this case, entropy flux does not increase fast enough, and boundary responsiveness is blunted. The system cannot accelerate disorder export. QIH remains low or negative throughout the night. As a result, the system wakes up with residual disorder in the form of metabolic, neural, or inflammatory entropy and enters the next day already depleted.

> **Health is not a fixed trait, but a dynamic process of managing disorder over time.**

In this way, QIH reveals **how well their system is accelerating entropy export in the window when it matters most.**

## 5. Health Implications

### Chronic Stress and Low QIH

Chronic sympathetic activation lowers both $$\( B(t) \)$$ and $\frac{d^2 \Phi(t)}{dt^2}$, suppressing QIH and increasing health risk.

### Sleep as Reset Mechanism

Interventions that restore circadian rhythm or deepen sleep (e.g., bright light, slow-wave stimulation) can raise QIH by restoring entropy acceleration.

### Real-Time QIH Estimation

Wearables tracking entropy-like signals (e.g., EEG variability, HRV) may enable real-time QIH estimation and health risk modelling.

QIH offers a new thermodynamic model of health. In sleep, it formalizes the role of disorder regulation, allowing measurable prediction of collapse or recovery. This unifies concepts across physiology, thermodynamics, and systems theory.

## 7. Conclusion

Sleep is an active export phase for entropy. High QIH during sleep reflects a system with intact adaptability. This paper proposes QIH as a measurable and testable equation for health, grounded in the physics of disorder regulation.
