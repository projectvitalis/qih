# qih
A universal, testable model of health as adaptive thermodynamic capacity.
# Qih Protocol

**Quantified Inference of Health (Qih)** is an open, cross-domain protocol for simulating and evaluating the health of adaptive systems — from humans to forests to artificial intelligence and more.

Health is formally defined as a thermodynamic capacity:  
> the ability of a system to manage entropy adaptively over time.

## What's Inside

- A formal paper introducing the Qih model
- Simulation notebooks (Colab-ready)
- Worked examples across biology, AI, and ecology
- A public challenge for falsifiability and critique

---

## Why This Matters

We offer a measurable signal of health — not as metaphor or diagnosis, but as a physical law.

All results are open for simulation, refinement, and public testing.
