# Project VITALIS

**A thermodynamic framework for understanding health, life, and consciousness**

---

## Welcome

Project VITALIS is an open, evolving framework that defines **health**, **life**, and **consciousness** in thermodynamic terms. It introduces a set of simple, quantitative definitions that can be applied to systems ranging from human bodies to ecosystems to artificial intelligence.

This repository hosts the core papers, simulation tools, and supporting materials. It is designed to be accessible to both scientists and curious generalists.

> üß≠ If you‚Äôre new to thermodynamics or complex systems, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthis work is designed to be explored one piece at a time. Start with the definitions or an example that interests you.

## Why This Work Matters

Traditional models of health and life tend to focus on static traits or outcomes. In contrast, this project proposes that health is best understood as a **thermodynamic capacity**‚Äîthe ability of a system to manage entropy adaptively over time.

> Entropy, in this context, refers to the degree of disorder or uncertainty in a system. Systems that can export entropy efficiently tend to survive and adapt; those that cannot tend to collapse.

This approach:

- Grounds life and health in physical principles  
- Allows for testable simulation and cross-domain comparisons  
- Offers a unifying lens across biology, medicine, AI, and ecology  
- Opens new ways to detect collapse, resilience, and recovery in complex systems

## Core Definitions

This work introduces three key quantities:

- **QIH (Quantified Inference of Health)**: A measure of adaptive entropy regulation  
- **QIL (Quantified Inference of Life)**: A measure of internal entropy gradients sustained through energy use  
- **QIC (Quantified Inference of Consciousness)**: A measure of the system's ability to compute and track self/non-self boundaries over time

Each is formalized using thermodynamic and information-theoretic terms, with clear units and equations.

> ‚öôÔ∏è QIH is measured in joules per kelvin per second squared (J/K¬∑s¬≤). This unit reflects how quickly and adaptively a system accelerates its ability to reduce disorder.  
> High QIH = high adaptive capacity.

## How the Work is Structured

### üìÑ Guild Papers
Each paper explores the framework in a specific domain. All are written in clear, accessible language with rigorous mathematical foundations.

- **Paper 01** ‚Äì *Metabolic Collapse and Adaptive Recovery*: Applies QIH to human health  
- **Paper 02** ‚Äì *Ecosystem Collapse at the Entropic Threshold*: Models Amazon rainforest resilience  
- **Paper 03** ‚Äì *Entropy Without Organs*: Applies QIH to artificial intelligence  
- **Paper 04** ‚Äì *Markets at the Edge*: Models market health and collapse through QIH

### üî¨ Simulator
An interactive Colab notebook allows you to test and visualize the model. You can plug in your own assumptions and watch how entropy dynamics affect system health.

> **Note**: The simulator is a conceptual tool, not a forecasting engine. It helps you explore how a system *might behave* under different entropy dynamics‚Äînot predict what *will happen* in the real world.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with the README** (you‚Äôre here).
2. **Choose a paper** that aligns with your interest area.
3. **Open the simulator** to experiment with the QIH framework.
4. **Explore the definitions** if you want to understand the equations in detail.

This project is designed to be modular. You can engage with it as a scientific tool, a conceptual model, or an experimental playground.
